I am a PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Porto (Portugal) and a doctoral researcher at INESC TEC within the <a href="https://vcmi.inesctec.pt/" target="_blank">Visual Computing and Machine Intelligence (VCMI) group</a>. My research interests include computer vision, explainable artificial intelligence, and machine learning for medical applications.

I did my MSc in Biomedical Engineering at the Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil), where I applied deep learning for skin disease diagnosis. Previously, I received a BSc in Control and Automation Engineering from the same university, including a full academic year at INP-ENSEEIHT (France) as a Visiting Student.
