I currently work in data engineering and am interested in research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare.

I did my MSc in Biomedical Engineering at Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil), where I applied deep learning for skin disease diagnosis. Previously, I received a BSc in Control and Automation Engineering from Federal University of Pernambuco (Brazil), with a full academic year at INP-ENSEEIHT (France) as a Visiting Student.

Research interests:

  - Computer Vision;

  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence;

  - Machine Learning for Medical Applications.
