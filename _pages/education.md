<i>Title:</i> Clinical decision support system for the diagnosis of skin cancer and Hansen’s disease using digital image analysis and deep neural networks (<a href="https://repositorio.ufpe.br/handle/123456789/50253" target="_blank">Original in Portuguese</a>) <br>

The aim of my project was to investigate the use of deep neural networks for skin lesion image analysis and classification. The outcome was a clinical decision support system for the early diagnosis of skin cancer and Hansen's disease, considering reports from healthcare professionals and adapted to the reality of Brazil.
<br><br>
I participated in a research group and collaborated in managing the machine learning experiments to support the diagnosis of Covid-19 based on hematological and biochemical tests.

<i>Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil</i> <br>
<i>Title:</i> Building a MATLAB application for repetitive controller projects (<a href=" {{ 'tcc_pedro_lima.pdf' | prepend: 'assets/pdf/' | relative_url}}" target="_blank">Original in Portuguese</a>) <br>
<i>Supervisor:</i> Fabrício Bradaschia (<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2086-7862" target="_blank">ORCID</a>, <a href="http://lattes.cnpq.br/7274295997961188" target="_blank">Lattes</a>) <br><br>

I was granted a scholarship to spend a full academic year at INP-ENSEEIHT (France) through a program supported by the French and Brazilian governments (CAPES/BRAFITEC).
<br><br>
For my final project, I developed a MATLAB application to support the design of control systems that utilize repetitive controllers. It is available on the <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/74759-repetitive-controller-designer" target="_blank">MathWorks website</a> and was later adapted into a <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/en16052451" target="_blank">journal article</a>. With this interactive tool, users can observe the impact of changing controller parameters on the system stability and determine the feasibility of this approach in their context. 
<br><br>
Participating in a robotics team, we developed a line-following robot simulator. We aimed to simulate the physical structure, behavior, and operations, enabling the user to observe the robot following the line according to the code. Our work resulted in four publications on conference proceedings <a href="https://www.sba.org.br/open_journal_systems/index.php/cba/article/view/523" target="_blank">describing how it works</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/LARS/SBR/WRE.2018.00103" target="_blank">adding new features</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/SVR.2019.00025" target="_blank">making it web-based</a>, and showing its <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/LARS/SBR/WRE.2018.00101" target="_blank">use as an educational tool</a>.
